You look out the window, and see shadows squiggling around the campus. A shudder ripples through you as you turn away abruptly from the window. You've spent the last couple hours banging out code for your project. Unfortunately, there is little to show. You sigh in defeat and pack up for the day, heading out while the rest of of your cohort members work diligently.

It mournfully meows again and turns towards the Indian restaurant, one of the few dining options in the area. As it walks away, it beckons you to follow with its tail.

You look at the dark building in unease. At this time, it should've still been open, hosting large amounts of people. But today, not a single person could be seen in the near vicinity. The wind picks up, carrying along with it a rancid odor. You think to yourself that the restaurant shouldn't be tossing used its' garbage so carelessly. You hear shuffling sounds coming from Hackbright, and turn around to greet fellow classmates - only, it's not them. You feel sharp alarm as you see raggedly dressed men walking towards you. A hollow pit forms at the bottom of your stomach and grows as they get closer.
